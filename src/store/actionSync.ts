// Keeps this device's game in step with a match's action log.
//
// The server's log (write-once slots 0, 1, 2, …) is the single order every
// device applies moves in. This device's own moves are applied at once (no
// waiting on the network) and queued as *pending*; one at a time, the head of
// the queue is written to the next free slot. When its slot comes back in the
// log the move is confirmed. When another device's move lands in that slot
// first (two players acting at the same moment: simultaneous picks, a
// click-through screen), this device rolls back to just before its pending
// moves, applies the other move, and replays its own on top: the ones still
// legal are written again, the rest are dropped.
//
// Invariant: with moves pending, the confirmed state (the log applied in
// order) is `pending[0].before`; with none pending, it's the live state.
//
// Game-agnostic: actions are opaque, and the state is whatever `snapshot`
// returns (game states are immutable, so a snapshot is just a reference).
